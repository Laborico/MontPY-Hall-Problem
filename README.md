This app was built using Flask and Jyserver to handle all the DOM modifications (I know, it could be a lot easier to use JS or P5 for python).

## How to run

#### Requirements:

```bash
python >= 3.8.0
```

#### Steps:

1. (Suggestion) Create a [virtual environment](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/how-to-create-a-virtual-environment-in-python) for python.
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` on the terminal (this will install all the needed python packages needed).
4. To start the server run `flask run`.
5. Go to 127.0.0.1:5000 (or localhost:5000) and you should see the app in there:D
